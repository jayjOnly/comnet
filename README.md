<h1> README - Design Network System Using Cisco </h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This project, "Design Network System Using Cisco," is the final project for the Computer Networks course. It involves the simulation and design of a network infrastructure for a building, utilizing Cisco technologies and tools. The goal of this project is to create a secure, efficient, and scalable network system that meets the communication needs of the building's occupants.

By using Cisco Packet Tracer or similar network simulation tools, we designed and configured a network that includes multiple subnets, routing protocols, switches, routers, VLANs, and network security features. This project demonstrates key concepts learned during the course, including network topology design, IP addressing, and security implementation.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
Cisco Packet Tracer (or any other network simulation tool)

<h2>Setup and Configuration</h2>
To explore the network simulation:

1. Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer.<br>
2. Open the simulation file located in the main directory.<br>
3. Review the network topology diagrams in the documentation file for a high-level overview of the network structure.<br>
4. For each device (router, switch), you can view and modify its configuration by using the command-line interface (CLI) or GUI available in Packet Tracer.<br>

<h2>How to Run the Simulation</h2>
1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer and load the simulation file. <br>
2. Start the simulation by running the network and observing packet flow between devices.<br>
3. You can interact with various network components, modify configurations, and test the performance of the network under different conditions.<br>
4. Use Packet Tracerâ€™s simulation mode to monitor traffic, troubleshoot issues, or test different configurations.<br>
